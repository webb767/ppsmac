Description: Creates seeds for simulation projects.  Uses the L'Eucyer
    "many separate streams" approach to allow users to create one or
    more unique streams per simulation run.  Can save, reload, and
    select among streams of random numbers for arbitrarily many
    projects.  From a batch of thousands of simulations, one can select
    any arbitrary "run" of the model and re-initialize it (replicate
    it) in isolation. The book-keeping work is done in an enviroment
    called ".pps". This simulation will alter the state of the user
    session's .RandomSeed variable so as to re-initialize a simulation
    exactly. This was developed on a Linux cluster for replication of
    simulations across many compute nodes, but it is also compatible
    with iteration on a single computer. Includes vignettes to explain
    some basics of the package and the usage of pseudo-random number
    generators (PRNG) (Johnson 2016).
